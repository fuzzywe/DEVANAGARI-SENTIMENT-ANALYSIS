# Advanced Sentiment Analysis for Devanagari Scripts

*Devaganari* is a powerful tool for sentiment analysis specifically tailored for Devanagari script languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and others. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, Janani enables in-depth analysis of textual data to determine sentiment trends, public opinion, and emotional insights in Devanagari-based languages. This project is ideal for applications in social media analysis, market research, and opinion mining.

## Key Features
- *Comprehensive Sentiment Classification*: Classifies text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, specifically optimized for Devanagari script languages.
- *Preprocessing for Devanagari Text*: Includes robust preprocessing techniques tailored to handle Devanagari characters, removing noise, tokenizing, and normalizing text.
- *Visualization Tools*: Generate word clouds, sentiment score distributions, and graphical insights to visually interpret sentiment trends in Devanagari texts.
- *Customizable and Scalable*: Janani’s modular design allows easy customization and scaling for different datasets and domains.

## Project Structure
- datasets/: Contains sample datasets for Hindi, Marathi, and other Devanagari-script languages.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- src/: Core source code files for preprocessing, model training, and sentiment classification.
- models/: Pre-trained models and configurations for sentiment classification.

## Installation
1. *Clone the repository*:
   bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/janani-sentiment-analysis.git

    cd janani-sentiment-analysis
   

3. *Install dependencies*:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. *Preprocess the Data*:
   Use the provided preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data:
   python
   python src/preprocess.py --input datasets/sample_data.csv --output datasets/cleaned_data.csv
   

2. *Train the Model*:
   Train the sentiment analysis model using the cleaned dataset:
   python
   python src/train_model.py --data datasets/cleaned_data.csv
   

3. *Analyze Sentiment*:
   Run sentiment analysis on new data:
   python
   python src/analyze_sentiment.py --input datasets/new_data.csv --output results/sentiment_analysis.csv
   

4. *Visualize Results*:
   Visualize sentiment distribution and word clouds:
   python
   python src/visualize.py --input results/sentiment_analysis.csv
   

## Example Notebooks
Explore example Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to understand data processing, training, and evaluation steps in detail. Each notebook is designed to be run independently, with explanations and visualizations for clarity.

## Requirements
The main dependencies required for Janani are listed in requirements.txt. Install all dependencies with:
```cpp
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


## Technologies Used
- *Python*: For data processing, model training, and analysis
- *NLP Libraries*: NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face Transformers for tokenization and model training
- *Machine Learning*: Scikit-learn for sentiment classification models
- *Visualization*: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud for visual representation of sentiment data

## Future Work
- *Multi-Language Support*: Expanding Janani’s capabilities to support additional Indian languages.
- *Advanced Models*: Integrating BERT-based or transformer models for improved accuracy in sentiment detection.
- *Real-Time Analysis*: Developing a live sentiment tracking dashboard for social media data.
